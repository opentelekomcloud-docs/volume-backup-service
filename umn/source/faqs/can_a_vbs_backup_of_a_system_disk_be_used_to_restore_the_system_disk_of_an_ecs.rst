Can a VBS Backup of a System Disk Be Used to Restore the System Disk of an ECS?
===============================================================================

Yes. You can restore the system disk using a VBS backup. Before restoring the system disk, you must detach it from the ECS.

You can also use a VBS backup of the system disk to create new EVS disks. However, newly created EVS disks cannot be used as system disks.
