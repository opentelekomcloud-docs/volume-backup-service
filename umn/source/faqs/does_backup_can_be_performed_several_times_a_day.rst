Does Backup Can Be Performed Several Times a Day?
=================================================

Yes. Up to 24 automatic backup jobs can be executed per day. Manual backup jobs have no such restriction.

The minimum frequency for policy-driven backup is once per integral hour. Manual backup can be performed at any frequency.
