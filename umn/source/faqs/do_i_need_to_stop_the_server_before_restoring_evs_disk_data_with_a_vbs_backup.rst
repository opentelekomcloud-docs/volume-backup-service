Do I Need to Stop the Server Before Restoring EVS Disk Data with a VBS Backup?
==============================================================================

Yes. Before restoring the EVS disk data using a VBS backup, you must stop the server to which the EVS disk is attached, and detach the EVS disk from the server. After the EVS disk data is restored, attach the EVS disk to the server and start the server.
