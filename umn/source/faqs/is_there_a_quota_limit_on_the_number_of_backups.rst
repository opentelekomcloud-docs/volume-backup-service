Is There a Quota Limit on the Number of Backups?
================================================

Yes, there is a quota limit.

This quota exists to prevent resource overuse. If you need to create more VBS backups, contact the administrator to apply for a higher quota.

What Is Quota?
--------------

Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources available to users, such as the maximum number of ECS or EVS disks that can be created.

If the existing resource quota cannot meet your service requirements, you can apply for a higher quota.

How Do I View My Quotas?

#. View the used and total quota of each type of resources on the displayed page.

   If a quota cannot meet service requirements, apply for a higher quota.
