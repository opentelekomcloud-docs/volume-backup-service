Why Are CSBS Backups Displayed on the VBS Backup Page?
======================================================

CSBS backups of ECSs are also displayed on the VBS backup page and can be distinguished from VBS backups by **Source** in the backup details.

To use CSBS to back up a server is to back up every disk of the server. These disk backups are displayed on the VBS backup list and can be directly used to restore disks.

Backups whose **Source** is **CSBS** can be deleted only on the CSBS page.
