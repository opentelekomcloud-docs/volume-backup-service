Why Add Tags to a VBS Backup or Backup Policy?
==============================================

Tags are used to identify and classify backups that are automatically or manually generated with VBS. Tags are used to filter and manage backup resources only. All backups with tags are centrally managed in TMS. They can be filtered by search criteria. When a tag is added to a backup policy, the tag applies to all backups generated by the backup policy.

A tag is described using a key-value pair. A backup or backup policy can have a maximum of 10 tags by default. Each tag has only one key and one value. The key and value can exist in either sequence in a tag. Each key is unique among all tags of a VBS backup or backup policy, whereas values can be repetitive or blank.
