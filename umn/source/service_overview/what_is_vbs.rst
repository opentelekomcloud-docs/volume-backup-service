What Is VBS?
============

This service is available only for users and projects where this service has already been used. For new users, disk backups will be created in a newly created default CBR disk vault. If you are new to OTC Cloud, go to the console of the next-generation service, Cloud Backup and Recovery (CBR), which integrates Volume Backup Service (VBS).

Volume Backup Service (VBS) provides snapshot-based data protection for Elastic Volume Service (EVS) disks.

VBS secures your data, even if an EVS disk is faulty or encounters a logical error (for example, mis-deletion, hacker attacks, and virus infection). It allows you to effortlessly back up your data, and these data backups can be used to restore data quickly.

VBS supports both full and incremental backup modes. By default, the system performs a full backup initially, and then performs incremental backups. You can use a data backup generated in either backup mode to restore the source EVS disk to the state the EVS disk was in when the backup was created.

VBS allows one-click backup and restoration for the EVS disks on servers all through its easy-to-use platform. These servers are Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs).
